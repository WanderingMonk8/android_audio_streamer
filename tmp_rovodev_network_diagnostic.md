# 🔍 Network Connectivity Diagnostic

## 🚨 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**

Your Android device reports:
- `hasInternet=false`
- `hasWifi=false` 
- `Active network: WIFI, connected: false`

**This means Android thinks it has NO network connectivity**, even though ping works.

## 🔧 **Immediate Solutions to Try**

### 1. **Check WiFi Connection Status**
- Go to Android Settings → WiFi
- Is there a "!" or "×" symbol next to your WiFi network?
- Does it say "Connected, no internet" or similar?

### 2. **Captive Portal Check**
- Open a web browser on your Android device
- Try to visit any website (google.com, etc.)
- Do you get redirected to a login page?
- If yes, complete the WiFi login process

### 3. **Network Validation**
- Go to Settings → WiFi → [Your Network] → Advanced
- Look for "Internet connectivity" or "Network validation"
- Try toggling these settings

### 4. **Reset Network Connection**
```bash
# On Android device:
Settings → WiFi → [Your Network] → Forget
Then reconnect with password
```

### 5. **Test Different Networks**
- Try connecting to a mobile hotspot
- Try a different WiFi network
- See if the issue persists

## 🎯 **Why This Explains Everything**

- **SonoBus works**: Might use different network APIs or bypass Android's connectivity checks
- **Ping works**: ICMP doesn't require Android's network validation
- **UDP fails**: Android blocks socket creation when it thinks there's no connectivity
- **WiFi MulticastLock works**: This is independent of connectivity validation

## 📱 **Quick Test Commands**

Run these on your Android device to check connectivity:

```bash
# Check if you can browse the internet
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "https://google.com"

# Check network interfaces
adb shell ip addr show

# Check routing table  
adb shell ip route show
```

## 🔄 **Next Steps**

1. **Fix the underlying connectivity issue** (captive portal, etc.)
2. **Test our app again** - it should work once Android reports proper connectivity
3. **If connectivity can't be fixed**, we'll need to implement a workaround

## 💡 **Alternative Approach**

If you can't fix the connectivity issue, we could try:
- Using raw sockets (requires root)
- Using a different networking library
- Implementing a TCP fallback
- Using Android's VPN API to bypass restrictions
