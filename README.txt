# Ultra-Low Latency Android-to-PC Audio Streaming App

## Overview

This project enables ultra-low latency audio streaming from an Android device to a PC over Wi-Fi. It supports system audio and microphone input, with configurable codec and playback options, targeting total latency under **10 milliseconds**.

---

## Features

* 🔊 **System Audio and Microphone Capture** on Android (Android 10+)
* 🎤 Optional **noise cancellation** for microphone input (built-in or RNNoise)
* 🎚️ **Selectable audio codecs** (Opus, PCM, AAC) with estimated latency displayed
* 🌐 **UDP-based Wi-Fi streaming** with optional Wi-Fi Direct mode
* 🖥️ **PC playback** via WASAPI, ALSA, or ASIO with device selection support
* ⚙️ Low-latency pipeline with threading, lock-free buffers, and real-time scheduling

---

## Requirements

### Android

* Android 10+
* Microphone and media capture permissions
* Foreground service permissions for background operation

### PC

* Windows, Linux, or macOS
* libopus, PortAudio (with ASIO support if using Windows)
* Python 3 or C++ compiler (depending on receiver version)

---

## Installation

### Android

1. Clone the repo and open the Android project in Android Studio.
2. Build and run the app on a device running Android 10 or later.

### PC Receiver (Python Prototype)

```bash
pip install pyaudio opuslib
python receiver.py
```

### PC Receiver (C++ Version)

1. Build using CMake with dependencies: libopus, PortAudio
2. Run binary and select desired audio device/backend (WASAPI, ALSA, ASIO)

---

## Usage

### On Android

1. Launch the app and select **System Audio** or **Microphone Mode**
2. Optionally enable **Noise Cancellation**
3. Select codec and view estimated latency
4. Enter the PC’s IP address manually or via QR pairing
5. Press **Start** to begin streaming

### On PC

1. Launch the receiver application
2. Select desired **audio output device** and backend (WASAPI/ASIO)
3. Start listening for incoming stream

## Performance Tips

* Use 5 GHz Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi Direct for best latency
* Enable real-time thread priorities (especially for C++ version)
* Use exclusive audio modes (WASAPI or ASIO)

---

## Troubleshooting

* 🔇 **No audio on PC?** Check firewall and ensure matching IP.
* ⚠️ **Lag or stutter?** Reduce codec complexity, buffer size, or switch Wi-Fi channel.
* 🧠 **High CPU usage?** Disable RNNoise and use built-in suppressor.
